# Boat_Assembly

This directory contains files used in the design/assembly of the boat. Files included are:

- Boat_Code3 (directory)

	This contains an Arduino file of the steering code for Jack Donnellan's boat. This code was written by Jack Donnellan and David Shekhtman. (as of 4/5/2018)

- Boat_Code3_Paul (directory)

	This contains an Arduino file of the steering code for the 3D-printed boat. This code was written by Jack Donnellan and David Shekhtman. (as of 4/5/2018)

- CAD & Drawings (directory)

	This directory includes CAD (SolidWorks) and drawing files of the boat hull and motor mount (initial version). These CAD files can be converted to .stl files and 3D-printed. Images of basic dimensioned drawings are also included.

- Photos (directory)

	Contains photos of Paul Kang and Jack Donnellan's boats.

- TankData (directory)

	This directory includes files from Dennis Larkin's thesis "An Experimental Testbed for Creating Controlled Lagrangian Coherent Structures", Drexel University, 2015. This thesis involved the creation of a similar boat for testing purposes. Files include Larkin's thesis, and CAD files of Larkin's boat. These files were useful in the design of our boat. Thanks to Dennis Larkin for providing these files.

- Cost of parts for small scale boat.xlsx

	An initial bill of materials for the boat. While this list contains all necessary components to construct the boat, any components that were later added are not included. The custom Arduino board was designed by Andrey Akhmetov, EE '20.

- Kang, Paul - Development of an Autonomous Boat.docx

	A description of the boat project, explaining the motivation behind and execution of the boat assembly. Contains explanations of design choices and boat systems.

- Waterproofing.docx

	A description of the motor alignment and waterproofing processes of the boat. These processes required a lot of troubleshooting.
