This directory contains files used in the design/assembly of the boat. Files included are:

- TankData (directory)

	This directory includes files from Dennis Larkin's thesis "An Experimental Testbed for Creating Controlled Lagrangian Coherent Structures", Drexel University, 2015. This thesis involved the creation of a similar boat for testing purposes. Files include Larkin's thesis, and CAD files of Larkin's boat. These files were useful in the design of our boat. Thanks for Dennis Larkin for providing these files.
