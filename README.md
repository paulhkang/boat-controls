This repository contains the code for a control system on an autonomous boat.

The two contributors to this repository are Paul Kang and Rayhan Syed.
We are students at The Cooper Union, located in New York City.


The bno055.c and bno055.h files are used in reading from the Bosch Sensortec BNO055 sensor.
These files, as well as more detailed documentation on the software, can be found at: https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BNO055_driver.
